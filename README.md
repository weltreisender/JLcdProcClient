JLcdProcClient
==============

Java client for LCDproc


Purpose of this project is to provide a Java client API to the LCDproc server used in Linux to provide
access to LCD displays.

The project is still work in progress. There is no documentation yet.
Also tests are still missing.

I hope to provide both as soon as possible.
